Smart Foot Over Bridges for enhanced safety and utility using IoT
Using sensors to receive real time data of a foot over bridge to help make predictions using Machine Learning model

Sensors Used:

Humidity and Temperature Sensor(DHT11)
Ultrasonic Sensor(HC-SR04)
PIR Motion Sensor
LDR Sensor
The sensors are Integrated with ESP8266MOD.

The real time data is used to generate a Machine Learning model to predict the activity of the Foot Over Bridge and help in maintenance. Logistic Regression is the algorithm used.

Blynk App is used to see the output
